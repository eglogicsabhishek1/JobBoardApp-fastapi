#Simple Job Board API
Overview
The Simple Job Board API is a backend API designed to manage job postings for a job board application. The API is built with FastAPI, uses PostgreSQL for persistent data storage, and SQLAlchemy for ORM database interaction.

This API allows users to create, read, update, and delete job listings. It is designed with a modular architecture to ensure scalability and maintainability.
